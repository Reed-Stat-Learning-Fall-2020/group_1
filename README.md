# Overview

The main goal for this project is to predict both future performance and salary for MLB pitchers from 2015-2019. This endeavor allows us to not only understand the metrics that underlie the two response variables, but also to investigate if a discrepancy exists between the predictors responsible for prospective pitching success and those responsible for a lucrative contract. 

This project was created by [Riley Leonard](https://github.com/rileyleonard99), [Andy Zhao](https://github.com/andjzhao), and [Josh Yamamoto](https://github.com/joshyam-k) for Math 243: Statistical Learning, at Reed College.

## Files

Although a full and very detailed technical report is available in the folder "Technical Report", all of the pieces that were stitched together to create that report are also available in this repo.

### Data

In this folder you can find the many iterations of our final data set readily available as `csv` files. We also included our markdown files which show our data scraping and joining process. Our final data set is fittingly named `Final Mega Summary.csv` and lives inside of this folder.

### Methods

THis folder contains a markdown file that thoroughly explains our data as well as provides insight into our data collection, cleaning, and preparation process. It also explains our reasons for adding variables and gives details how we created and implemented them.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In this folder you can find a `.rmd` which includes a very thorough exploration of our final data set. Some salient features include: scatterplots of predictors against response variables, scatterplots of predictors against predictors (to look for collinearity), and correlation calculations.

### Models

Living in this folder are a large number of markdown files where each one corresponds to a certain kind of model that we played around with. Also included in this folder are the two `.rmd`s "Extensions_and_Discussion.Rmd" and "Data_Section.Rmd". These files give a pretty detailed summary of how our models performed as well as some reasons for why we saw those results. We also drew some conclusions based on our findings and created some advanced visualizations to support them.

### Code Appendix

This folder is a bit of a dump for all of the code that we used for this project as well as all of the packages that we utilized, but everything that we used is truly here.
